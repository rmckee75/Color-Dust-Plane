# Color Paint Plane
My Engineering 4 Pi in the Sky Project
## Basic Objective 
Design a plane which will fly through the air, changing directions and speeds as controlled by the user on a computer connected by SSH, and releasing various colors of paint based on the acceleration, drawing a path of flight on the ground (probably concrete or asphalt) which is changes in color based on the acceleration.
## Criteria & Constraints
- Must be completed by the end of the schoolyear (May 28th is the last day for seniors, but I could (probably?) continue to come in if necessary until June 11th)
- Must use materials which are easily available in the Sigma Lab or can be easily bought/acquired (such as paint)
-
